# Instructions for a good use of the mini project Theo / Mathis CIR2

## Site part

For the site part, there is no special information, except that the set of default passwords for users are "mdp" to connect. 

## Database part

To use the project, you must start by creating a database named "bddisen". 
Then, two possibilities : 
- the first one is to use VS Code to import the database using the "SQLTools PostgreSQL" extension
- the second one is to copy and paste directly in command line the model.sql and data.sql files
